## Part 1:


* Part 1
   *  IRC Channel ![img](http://puu.sh/oAcwO/77cd244d35.png)
   
   * The PokeSnowdown channel is used primarily to work on or repair issues with the Pokemon Snowdown game mode.
   While sparcely used, it can be observed to find the few users recognizing bugs and implementing fixes. 

* Part 2
   * While the RCOS slack community functions majorly across channels such as "General" or "Proposals", most project groups have their own private channels 
   where most of their work is discussed. The channel in general seems to be a place where like minded individuals can congregate and share knowledge
   
* Part 3
   * The first part of this was already done in part 1.
   
   * Titan Pad (I said Destructo Disk!) ![img](http://puu.sh/oAcw8/07ef792e83.png)
   
   * Questions:
     * Synchronous communication is something like a chatroom where information is being reveived and sent immediately 
     whereas asynchronous is like an e-mail where data is sent but when it is received and read is not known.
   
      * In individual interactions things can be discussed easily and directly, 
      whereas in a group setting things are hectic and ideas or ideals can clash.
   
      * In collaborative software, often the boundaries between who did what can get muddled. 
      For example, if two people work on the same problem together but only one names goes on the face of the solution.
   
      * An issue that HCI has with Human inention can be seen through how easy it is to interact and socialize without actually
      physically interacting with anyone. For example, there is an upward trend in people in the workforce working from home
      meaning that they do not have it interact with their coworkers or work superiors at all, and combine that with the continued effort
      of supermarkets to provide delivery groceries, individuals are being stripped of their need to even step outside.
      
* Part 4
    * While making sure your code works is very important, in a group project it is also important for code to be fluid in the sense
    that it can be easily navigated through. It is important to establish a sort of standard for all members of the group
    or learn to follow after one persons lead. that and adding comments to and around code to facilitate understanding the code
    can work wonders for each group member.
