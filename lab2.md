1. Read

2. Licenses define how a program can be shared modified and used.
They also regulate the process on how something is modified and distributed (i.e whether or not the name must be changed after modification or if the original source code needs to be included when shared)

3. If the project doesn't have an explicit license then someone can alter the source code and creat a modified version that they can then limit who can use said project.  

4. The claim written explains much of why the Gopher project was inferior in both technological and societal standpoints, and while the points made are true I think that a lot of boils down to luck. Between two formats that are nearly identical in product, even if one performs the task better than the other that does not necesarrily mean that it will be the more favored product. In short, even if the Gopher project had been in all ways superior to the Web, it is entirely possible that it still would have failed due to some other factor, like the Web being discovered first and taking off before Gopher could make a name for itself.

5. Linux's use of the GPL v2 license dictates the the user, when sharing modified versions of the source code must make the original source code available. This allows any person that obtains a modified version to implement changes or revert changes as they see fit, and gives users more freedom of use of the product. It is also specifically stated that linux does not intend to move on to version 3 because it inhibits freedom in terms of the digital rights management.

6. MIT license

7.The GPL license is better for the common good as it allows users to modify the code anyway they want. The Apache license is best used for developers because it shows the original developers are contributors and keeps them from being liable for any damage done by further modifications. The LGPL license is best for companies because it prevents modifications from creating a sublicense of their source code.
